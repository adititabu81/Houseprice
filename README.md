# Houseprice
The dataset is taken from Kaggle Competition -House Prices:Advanced Regression Techniques:https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

This competition challenges us to predict the  final price of each home with given 79  explanatory variables describing (almost) every     aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa

In this project we worked with machine learning   libraries do to predictive analysis of adataset.We  performed data preprocessing which included data visualization, Removing outliers, handling  missing data, dropping columns, adding new ones, converting categorical variables into numeric ones using label encoder or dummies as regression canâ€™t be done on categorical variables. Then We tried various algorithms to build the final model using the training data and ensembling of the algorithms in bagging fashion based on their accuracy on the training data. We  achieved score of 0.11434 on submitting the predictions on the test data. We used model stacking to achieve best accuracy in our predictions.
